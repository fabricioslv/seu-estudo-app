# Seu-Estudo - Supabase Migration and Configuration Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the installation of Supabase CLI, configuration of the local development environment, and creation of migration files that document the current database schema and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## 1. Supabase CLI Installation

### Installation Process
1. Downloaded the latest Supabase CLI binary for Windows
2. Extracted the binary to a user-accessible location
3. Added the CLI to the system PATH for global access

### Verification
- Supabase CLI version: 2.48.3
- Successfully initialized local Supabase project
- Linked local project to remote Supabase project (Project ID: omhcypacmlnreiizqhdo)

## 2. Database Schema Documentation

### Tables Identified
The following tables were found in the public schema:
- alunos
- livros
- mensagens
- notas
- notificacoes
- planos_estudo
- professores
- questoes
- respostas_usuario
- simulados
- teams
- users
- usuarios

### RLS Policies
All tables have Row Level Security enabled with appropriate policies:
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies for most tables
- Special policy for `planos_estudo` table that restricts access to user-owned records
- All policies use permissive access with appropriate conditions

## 3. Migration Files Created

### File: `20251005135445_remote_schema.sql`
This migration file documents:
- Commands to enable RLS on all existing tables
- DROP and CREATE statements for all RLS policies
- Specific policy definitions for each table including:
  - Generic CRUD access policies for most tables
  - Specialized policies where needed (e.g., user ownership restrictions)

## 4. Local Development Setup

### Directory Structure
```
seu-estudo/
├─ supabase/
│  ├─ migrations/
│  │  └─ 20251005135445_remote_schema.sql
│  ├─ config.toml
│  └─ .temp/
└─ backend/
   └─ ... (application code)
```

## 5. Next Steps

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Install Docker Desktop**: Required for full Supabase CLI functionality including local development
2. **Review RLS Policies**: Audit existing policies to ensure they meet security requirements
3. **Version Control**: Add migration files to Git for team collaboration
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular database backup procedures
5. **Monitoring**: Set up database performance monitoring and alerting

### Future Migration Management:
- All new database schema changes should be added as new migration files
- Follow semantic versioning for migration file names
- Include both up and down migration scripts
- Test migrations in staging environment before applying to production

## 6. Security Considerations

### Current State:
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Basic access policies are in place
- User data isolation is implemented for `planos_estudo` table

### Recommendations:
- Review and tighten access policies based on business requirements
- Implement row-level access controls for sensitive data
- Regular security audits of database permissions
- Consider implementing audit logging for critical operations

## Conclusion

The Supabase CLI has been successfully installed and configured, and the current database schema has been documented in migration files. This provides a solid foundation for future database development and ensures that the database configuration can be version-controlled and replicated across environments.
